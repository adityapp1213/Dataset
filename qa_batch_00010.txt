on IQ tests is dependent on the test-taker's ability to learn the specific skills tested and the environment in which the test is taken.[31]

In the context of IQ tests, it is important to understand the validity of the test. IQ tests are designed to measure cognitive abilities, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. These tests are based on the assumption that there is a universal standard of intelligence that can be measured accurately across different populations. However, there are limitations to the validity of IQ tests. One limitation is that IQ tests are culturally biased and may not accurately reflect the intelligence of individuals from different cultural backgrounds. Another limitation is that IQ tests may not capture the full range of human intelligence.

For example, let's consider a scenario where a group of students is given an IQ test to measure their cognitive abilities. The test consists of a series of questions that assess various aspects of intelligence, such as verbal reasoning, logical thinking, and pattern recognition. The students are given a set amount of time to complete the test.

In this scenario, one of the students, named Emily, is from a different cultural background than the majority of the students. Emily grew up in a small town where access to educational resources was limited.
