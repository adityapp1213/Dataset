The document concludes with a plea for the government to "take action" and "strengthen" the measures against copyright infringement and piracy.

"The government must take decisive action to protect intellectual property rights and ensure that the digital economy is a safe and fair space for creativity and innovation," the rights groups urge.

They believe that by implementing stricter regulations and penalties for copyright infringement, the government can deter individuals from engaging in illegal activities and encourage the development of legal digital platforms.

The coalition of entertainment groups and search engine companies is hopeful that their recommendations will be taken seriously by the government and lead to positive changes in the fight against copyright infringement.

"We are committed to working together with the government and industry partners to create a legal and secure online environment," the BPI spokesperson stated.

"By addressing this issue, we can protect the rights of content creators and ensure that consumers have access to high-quality and legally obtained digital entertainment."

The coalition's call for action reflects the growing concerns among the entertainment industry and search engines regarding the prevalence of copyright infringement on the internet.

As the battle against piracy continues, it is crucial for individuals to be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions to support legal content
